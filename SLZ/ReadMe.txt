SLZ_1993.txt is a copy of a post I made to Usenet in the early 1990's.  Early posts and more discussion around the LZ variant I wrote has been lost as far as I know but this is an "essential archive" of the algorithm I released.  The file includes the full body of the post (minus headers).  Some information is out of date -- specifically the email mentioned in the post no longer exists.  Please contact me at adisak@gmail.com for current email.
